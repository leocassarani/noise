# Noisy

Noisy is a command-line utility that injects a customisable amount of
random noise into a stream of bytes coming from standard input.

In particular, this is accomplished by flipping a user-defined
percentage of bits, chosen at random. The resulting (noisy) stream is
written to standard output.
