# Noisy

Noisy is a command-line utility that injects a customisable amount of
random noise into a stream of bytes coming from standard input.

Noisy accomplishes this by flipping a user-defined amount (e.g. 25%) of
bits in the input stream, chosen at random. The resulting (noisy) stream
is written to standard output.
